                            4) Plenty of ways to add supports: sentence starters, word prediction, many opportunities for supporting decoding/encoding skills.

                        <!-- <div id="dino1" onclick="document.getElementById('dino1').play()" ondblclick="document.getElementById('dino1').pause()">The first dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic Period, and were much smaller than the dinosaurs that would emerge later on.  One of these early dinosaurs was the Coelophysis.  The Coelophysis was a carnivore— a "meat eater", walked on two legs, and was about 9 feet long and 3 feet tall: that's about as tall as a 3-year-old.  Coelophysis hunted in packs and even though they were small, they were very good hunters.  What made Coelophysis such good hunters was that they had extremely good vision; it is believed that a Coelophysis could see 8 times as far as humans can— which allowed them to spot prey (the dinosaurs they hunted) from a long distance.</div> -->
